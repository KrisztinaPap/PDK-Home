# [PDK-Home](https://pocketsdk.org)

Custom website built for PocketsDK (PDK), a YouTube content creator.

## Project Challenges:
The challenging part of this project was giving the client exactly what he needed, nothing more and nothing less. 

PocketsDK creates YouTube content for PC video games with his main passion being EVE Online, a space MMO where he runs the corporation MALRO Industries. He also has a presence - with plans of scaling up - on Discord, Twitch, Twitter, and Patreon. Most of his interactions with his audience happen on YouTube via comments, and in the two large Discord communities he manages, one for his brand, PocketsDK, and another for MALRO. He explained that he needs a URL/domain he can send people to as, for example, he speaks on an EVE podcast or talks about his business in a real life. He needed this landing website to collect all potential audience members, whether they were looking for a space corporation to join or liked one of his other gameplay videos, therefore, the website had to clearly explain the connection/difference between PDK and MALRO, promote the PDK brand, and then funnel visitors into the appropriate Discord chat room. He stressed that he wanted a mobile-friendly, clean landing page that people could access on the go. No monetization, no advertisements. Additionally, he wanted a couple of pages where he could add links to some of his favourite resources, websites he uses in his tutorials and play-throughs. Finally, he asked if it was possible to also create a tool for him that he could use to choose winners for his draws as the ones he was familiar with were loaded with advertisements.
